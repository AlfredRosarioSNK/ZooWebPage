# Welcome to my project, here is a little tutorial to teach you how to start.

#Requisites
<ul>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Git</li>  
<li>Flask</li>  
</ul>
First. On git, once you are in the path where you want to clone the repository type the following in the git console 

***git init https://github.com/AlfredRosarioSNK/ZooWebPage***

This command will clone the repository to the path you specified, the project has a file called has a file called environment.yml, cloning the repository with also install the necessary libraries so you're halfway there.

Then install an environment manager

This link will help if you get any trouble: ***https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anacondaorg/user-guide/getting-started/***

In my case i am using anaconda as you see. Since you already installed everything you need in git and cloned the repository, in anaconda you just need to goto the main path of the project and type the following in the command line:

***Python index.py***

This should initialize the project without any problem.

if you want to use my info (like the animal names, interesting facts and images) there is the ip acces to my data base on mongodb atlas: ***10.0.0.0/8*** can use this one too ***179.53.30.244/32***
