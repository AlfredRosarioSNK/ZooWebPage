# Welcome to my project, here is a little tutorial to teach you how to start.

#Requisites
<ul>
<li>Git</li>  
<li>Anaconda</li>
</ul>

***git is the most famous version controller software, therefore it is the one we will be using in this tutorial.***

first of all you need to download and install git, this link will help: ***https://git-scm.com/downloads***

Then the next thing is to do git getting started and configure it to your liking, for now then we will leave git aside and download the following software ***Anaconda***

Anaconda is a free and open distribution of the Python and R languages, used in data science and machine learning. This is the environment manager for python that we will be using, I have a link for you here: ***https://www.anaconda.com/***

Follow the documentation on the page and the steps to follow to configure it correctly, then you can continue with the tutorial.

Continuing with the tutorial then, I suppose you already have your code editor installed, if you don't have it you can go download and install it since as you can imagine it is very necessary, for example I use visual studio code: ***https://code.visualstudio.com/***


With everything you need installed, open git and go to the directory where you want to put the clone repository and type the following at the command line:

***git clone https://github.com/AlfredRosarioSNK/ZooWebPage***

This command will clone the repository to the path you specified ***(in my case in the desktop, so for example I wrote "cd desktop" when I open git and then the command up there)***, the project has a file called environment.yml, this file clone the environment and also install the necessary libraries so you're halfway there.

Cool then! Once you have done this, the clone repository should already be on your computer so open conda and go to the path of your project, you can do this opening the folder that contains the repository, copying the path in the file explorer and paste it in anaconda with the "cd" command, like this:

cd C:\Users\Alfred\Desktop\Flask zoo page

Cool, so now if you write the following command

***Python index.py***

This should initialize the project without any problem.
