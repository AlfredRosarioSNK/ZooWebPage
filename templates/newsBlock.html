          <h4>Criminal Cases for Killing Eagles Decline as Wind Turbine Dangers Grow</h4>
          <p>ROLLING HILLS, Wyo. (AP) — Criminal cases brought by U.S. wildlife officials for killing or harming
            protected bald and golden eagles dropped sharply
            in recent years, even as officials ramped up issuing permits that will allow wind energy companies to kill
            thousands of eagles without legal consequence.</p>

          <h4>Surfing Gator Seen Relaxing at Alabama Beach Amid the Waves</h4>
          <p>There are plenty of alligators in Alabama. But how many enjoy a day at the beach?

            One such unlikely critter was spotted riding the waves recently on Dauphin Island, bobbing calmly near the
            human beachgoers sunbathing and wading.

            Matt Harvill, a 27-year-old Mobile resident, came across the lengthy gator on May 7 while at the beach
            taking pregnancy announcement photos with his girlfriend.</p>

          <h4>Herders in Kenya Kill 10 Lions, Including Loonkiito, One of the Country's Oldest</h4>
          <p>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — One of Kenya’s oldest wild lions was killed by herders and the government has
            expressed concern as six more lions were speared at another village on Saturday, bringing to 10 the number
            killed last week alone.

            The male lion named Loonkiito was 19 years old and was described as frail by Kenya Wildlife Service
            spokesperson Paul Jinaro, who said it wandered out of the Amboseli national park into a village in search of
            food on Thursday night.</p>
